# solid-tiddlywiki-syncadaptor

Another attempt to make tiddlywiki a frontend for SoLiD Server.

## Todo

Full text search on SoLiD POD is currently impossible, and is [hard on TW](https://github.com/rsc/tiddly/issues/3).

## Acknowledgements

I've learnt the code of [bourgeoa's tiddlywiki-node-solid-server](https://github.com/bourgeoa/tiddlywiki-node-solid-server)
